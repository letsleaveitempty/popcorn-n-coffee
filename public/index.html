<h2>Synchronizing git repositories - how to?</h2>

<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Step 1:  Git  Remotes</h4>

<br/>

<p>What is a git remote repository? Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet(e.g. GitHub) or network somewhere (e.g. on your computer).</p>

<p>The goal is to synchronize your local, origin and upstream remote.
<ul>
  <li>UPSTREAM - upstream project repository on GitHub (original one)</li>
  <li>ORIGIN - forked project repository on your personal GitHub account</li>
  <li>LOCAL - cloned repository on your computer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In your application directory:</p>

<div style="margin-left:70px; width:100%;">
<p>git remote  -v</p>
<p># shows current remotes</p> 
<p>git remote add upstream htttps://github.com/otherusername/otherrepositoryname.git</p>
<p># creates upstream remote</p>
<p>git remote -v</p>
<p># please, verify if new remote is created</p>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Step 2:  Sync Upstream and Local Remote</h4>

<br/>

<div style="margin-left:70px; width:100%;">
<p>git fetch upstream</p>
<p># grabbing upstream branches</p>
<p>git branch -va</p>
<p># see branches list from all remotes</p>
</div>

<p>If there were branches added to original repository (upstream), they are automatically added to local remote (and visible on the list via git branch -va).
In case there were changes on a branch you had on your local remote before,  you have to merge each branch separately:</p>

<div style="margin-left:70px; width:100%;">
<p>git checkout master</p>
<p># make sure you are on branch master</p>
<p>git merge upstream/master</p>
<p># merge upstream master into your local master</p>
</div>

<p>Repeat with all changed branches (if you want to have them synchronized :) )</p>
<div style="margin-left:70px; width:100%;">
<p>git checkout nameofthebranch</p>
<p>git merge upstream/nameofthebranch</p>
</div>

<br/>

<p>Tadaam! From now on you can use actual version of original repository (on your computer).</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Step 3:  Sync Local and Origin Remote</h4>

<br/>

<p>To synchronize your origin remote, you have to push changes from your computer:</p>

<div style="margin-left:70px; width:100%;">
<p>git checkout nameofthebranch</p>
<p># make sure you are on the branch you need to sync</p>
<p>git push origin nameofthebranch</p>
<p># pushes branch into origin, creates a new one in case it doesnâ€™t exist</p>
</div>

<p>Repeat for all branches you want to synchronize.
Be careful with names: git push nameofthebranch  tries to push version from your local remote into original one (upstream). And it will fail...</p>

<br/>

<p>Tadaam, taadaaam, taaadaaaam!!!  All remotes are the synchronized, plus you have your commits saved on origin remote.</p>
